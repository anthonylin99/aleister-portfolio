# Bible philosophy

All code, refactors, and design decisions in this repo must align with **[bible.md](../../bible.md)**.

Before proposing changes:

1. **Read bible.md** — it defines the Prime Directive (long-term stewardship), Core Engineering Pillars (architecture over expediency, radical reliability, documentation as code), the Considerate Coworker protocol, the tactical checklist, and how we fight entropy.

2. **Apply it** — no quick fixes that violate architecture; fail loudly (no empty catches); immutable-by-default in financial logic; strict typing; document the "why"; leave the campsite cleaner; consider ripple effects; preserve tests and safety checks.

3. **Filter every change** by idempotency, observability, separation of concerns, and edge-case resilience (see Tactical Implementation Checklist in bible.md).

If a suggestion conflicts with bible.md, reject or revise the suggestion.
